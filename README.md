# Finding the shortest path with Dijkstra's algorithm
Just a simple project made for uni to visualise how to find the shortest path with the Dijsktra's algorithm. Made with C++ and the SFML library.

## Projects
- zadatak1 finds the shorthest path but with the Command line.
- zadatak2 does the same, but more visually pleasing with the SFML library.
